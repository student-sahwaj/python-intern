Project Overview

This project is a FastAPI-based web application developed as part of the technical assessment for the Python Developer Intern position at Qixbi Technologies. The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in Python, FastAPI, and database management by implementing user authentication via Google OAuth and providing CRUD operations for managing stock watchlists.

Features

Authentication System:

Implemented Google OAuth 2.0 integration.

Stored authenticated user information.

Created secure session management.

Protected routes for authorized users.

CRUD Operations for Watchlists:

Create, read, update, and delete watchlist entries.

List all watchlist entries for the logged-in user.

Database Management:

PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions.

Two tables: User and Watchlist.

API Documentation:

Automatic API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI.

Additional Features:

Input validation and error handling.

RESTful API design principles.

Environment variable management for sensitive credentials.

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

PostgreSQL database

A Google Cloud project with OAuth credentials

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url cd your-repo-folder

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # Linux/macOS venv\Scripts\activate # Windows

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/your_db SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key

Apply database migrations:

alembic upgrade head

Start the application:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

Running the Application

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to access the application.

API documentation is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

API Endpoints

Authentication Endpoints

GET /auth/google/login - Redirect to Google for authentication.

GET /auth/google/callback - Handle the callback after Google authentication.

GET /auth/logout - Logout the user.

Watchlist CRUD Endpoints

POST /watchlist/ - Create a new watchlist entry.
